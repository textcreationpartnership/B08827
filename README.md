#A controversy between the Quakers & bishops, occasioned by the bishops summoning them to their courts, and calling them in question for matters of religion: Contrary to the practice of Christ and the Apostles, who never forced any about religion and worship: and contrary to the Kings promises, speeches and declarations, which saith, no man shall be disquieted for different opinions in matters of religion, they living peaceably under the government; which the Quakers do, and no man can charge them to the contrary. Together with several religious reasons recorded concerning the conscientious non-conformity of the Quakers, to those things that are by the bishops courts imposed upon them.#
